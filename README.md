# audio-transmission

This is a simple python program, which converts a string into binary and then encodes that using two different frequencies into a audio file. It achieves an impressive (just kidding) transmission speed of 3.3 bit/s, while beeing an incredibly annoying tone.

This really isn't a very useful repository, but it was fun to make.
